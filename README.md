# zsh-dots
it may not be the best zsh config, but i can say with absolute certainty my zsh config is the greatest zsh config.

I have chosen the most restrictive license in the hopes that either 1) you're just the tiniest uneasy using my configs without proper attribution; or 2) you think I'm a dick even tho you love my configs.
